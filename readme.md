# QR Dynamics

is the next iteration of [my dyanmic QR code generator](https://github.com/oliver-dvorski/qr).

I'm trying to create this without a component CSS framework.

Right now the project is at a stage where all supported types of static codes can be generated. The frontend deals with that. Dynamic codes are quite a bit more complex. So far only dynamic web codes are being generated.

# Installation
The installation instructions have changed. I'll update this readme as soon as I make them simple enough for sharing.

# ToDo
- [x] eslint
- [x] Docker
- [ ] Testing
- [x] Hot module reload - Decouple front end
- [ ] A11y optimisation
