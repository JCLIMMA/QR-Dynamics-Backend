# QR Dynamics

is the next iteration of [my dyanmic QR code generator](https://github.com/oliver-dvorski/qr).

I'm trying to create this without a component CSS framework.

Right now the project is at a stage where all supported types of static codes can be generated. The frontend deals with that. Dynamic codes are far more complex. Getting those to work is the current todo list.
